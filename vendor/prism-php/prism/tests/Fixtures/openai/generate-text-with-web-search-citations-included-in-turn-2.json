It provides weather forecasts, radar, and other meteorological data using a combination of in-house modeling and data from major sources like the UK Met Office and ECMWF.\n\n**Reliability Factors:**\n\n- **Reputation:** Metcheck is popular and widely used by the public, but it is not the UK\u2019s *official* weather authority; that would be the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/), the United Kingdom\u2019s government meteorological organization.\n- **Data Sources:** While Metcheck uses good models and often aligns with official sources, it is considered a *secondary* source. Primary and most authoritative data for the UK comes from the Met Office.\n- **Accuracy:** Day-of and short-range forecasts on Metcheck are generally quite accurate, but official warnings and statements (especially for extreme weather) are best sourced directly from the Met Office or the BBC.\n\n**In summary:**  \n- Metcheck is *reasonably reliable* for general, daily forecasts.\n- For the *most authoritative and official information*, refer to the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/forecast/gcpvj0v07) or [BBC Weather](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/2643743).\n- For academic, legal, or critical uses, always cite the Met Office.\n\n**Citations:**\n- [How reliable are private weather forecasting sites? | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2011/apr/24/how-reliable-private-weather-forecast-websites)\n- [Met Office official site](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk)\n\nIf you\u2019d like the **official forecast for London from the Met Office or BBC**, let me know!"
