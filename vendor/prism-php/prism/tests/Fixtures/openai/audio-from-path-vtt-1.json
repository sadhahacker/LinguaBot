WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
by that conference. So I think that's a good excuse to be on the newsletter, too, is like,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.440
yeah, find out about 1.0 as soon as possible. Yeah, totally. Yeah, I like that idea. Then

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.760
that gets you not as much pressure for tagging 1.0 before you go to Larikon. It gets an added

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.120
benefit of getting people on the newsletter and a little bit more exposure in there. And then

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.560
in the meantime before you can, I don't know, maybe start drafting up newsletter launch email

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:45.040
number one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I might. Right now I'm using button down email for everything. May

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.599
consider switching over to Bento just because Aaron loves it. And I like using things that

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:57.680
people recommend. So. Yeah. I might I might switch providers right before I pull the trigger on it.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.919
So that's that's something I'm gonna have to look at and maybe I'll I'll work on on the plane or

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:06.879
something. I'm on my way out to Denver. I know it's just getting close, man. I leave on Sunday.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:12.879
It's Thursday. So this is all coming up really quick and there's a lot I want to do. So,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.760
yeah, maybe I don't sleep tonight. Yeah. But even if you just like captured email

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.239
addresses like you can always export them, import them into the new place anyways.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.480
Yep. Yeah. A hundred percent. So cool, man. Moving on from newsletters. I think you had

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.599
added something here about cloud custom commands and that's something that we talked about, I think

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:40.000
last week a little bit and maybe starting to find some excuses for using slash custom slash

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.519
commands and stuff. So I'd love to hear about your experience here. Yeah, definitely. So

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.760
this was definitely prompted from last week's conversation. And as I'm working through the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.639
week, I was like, OK, what can I possibly make a custom command for? So I basically started off

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:07.599
with two things. I created like a refresh repo command, which basically like you run it, it

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:17.759
scans it basically like re-initiates the the cloud MD file. It reads what's there. It looks at the

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:23.919
application, sees any new like dependencies or commands or whatever the case is and updates

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:31.279
anything that it deems important to add back to that markdown file. And it's just nice if you

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:37.279
have like a repo that has a lot of development, a lot of people working in it, and you don't always

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:44.559
want to capture every single new like merge or rebase like every other day to it. So maybe your

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.720
updates running that like the repo refresh like once a week or something like that would be good

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.440
because then you don't have to type out like, oh, rescan the repo and do this and that and the other

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.720
thing like now this will just take care of it. So that was I think the first one that I made. So

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.639
that one's been really helpful refreshing everything because the first time I ran it,

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:10.080
it picked up like I think I last time I refreshed it was I don't know, three, four weeks ago.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.720
So I found like a whole bunch more stuff. It updated like architecture changes, like a whole

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.240
bunch of things to it. So that's been really helpful. Probably gonna run that like on a

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:28.080
weekly basis now on all the repos that we're working on. The other one is what I just named

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.199
like a branch context. It's like I'm either switching to a branch that I'm working on

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:41.199
or pulling down for a review or something like that of like the repo refreshes for main branch.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.919
And then when I'm going into something else like scan for changes, tell me what's in the last

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:50.960
handful of commits and kind of refresh your understanding of what has changed in the repo

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.960
in here. And then we can either work towards something else together or I'm asking you for

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.759
why did this change or why did that change or whatever the case is. It's just refreshing

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:06.240
the immediate context for that branch. So that's been helpful as well.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.800
That's sick.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.559
Yeah. So I guess I'll pause there because then I have another whole workflow. So any questions

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:17.440
on either one of those or any specific details that you want?

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.440
No, man. I think that sounds great. Like those are very useful things to have as slash commands.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:32.880
Yeah. I'm still personally finding my own use cases for them. I haven't dove too far into it yet.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.320
But maybe after Laracon, I'll spend a little time coming up with some stuff. But I think those are

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:45.839
I think it serves as some decent inspiration for some other slash commands I'm thinking

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:47.839
up right now. So yeah. What else you got?

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:56.239
Um, yeah. So the next one, which I do a lot is PR reviews for others and coming into like a new

00:04:56.239 --> 00:05:02.000
tech stack. Like there's some things I am just not aware about or like best practices or whatever.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.600
So there's a default slash review command that comes out of the box and cloud code. And that

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.480
gives a decent understanding. Like it'll tell you, you know, what's changed, what maybe some of the
