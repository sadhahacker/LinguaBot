This absurdist answer, which took 7.5 million years to compute, has become one of the most recognized references in science fiction. The joke lies in the fact that while the computer provided a precise numerical answer, nobody knew what the actual question was. The number 42 has since become a cultural touchstone, symbolizing the futility of seeking simple answers to profound existential questions, and appears in numerous Easter eggs throughout various media as a nod to Adams' influential work."}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":593,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":328,"service_tier":"standard"}}
