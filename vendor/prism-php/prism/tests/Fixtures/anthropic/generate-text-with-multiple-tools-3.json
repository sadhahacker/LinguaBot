What time is the Tigers game today?\nThe Tigers game is scheduled for 3:00 PM today in Detroit.\n\n2. Should I wear a coat?\nBased on the weather forecast for Detroit, it will be 75°F (about 24°C) and sunny. Given this warm and pleasant weather, you likely won't need a coat. A light jacket or sweater might be comfortable if you tend to get chilly in the evening, but it's generally warm enough that you should be comfortable without a coat.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the game or the weather?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":650,"output_tokens":145}}
