            "text": "Okay, let's break down Occam's Razor. **Explanation of Occam's Razor:** Occam's Razor (also spelled Ockham's Razor, and known in Latin as *Lex Parsimoniae*, the Law of Parsimony or Stinginess) is a **problem-solving principle**, not ▶ The core idea is: **When presented with competing hypothetical explanations for a phenomenon, you should select the one that makes the fewest assumptions.** In simpler terms: **The simplest explanation is usually the best one.** It doesn't say the simplest explanation is *always* correct, just that it's the most likely to be correct or the one you should investigate first. It encourages ▶ Think of it as being \"stingy\" with adding extra layers or factors that aren't strictly needed to explain something. **Simple, Everyday Example:** Imagine you come home and find a plate broken on the kitchen floor. You weren't home when it happened. *   **Explanation 1 (Complex):** A small earthquake occurred precisely at the moment the plate was sitting precariously on the edge of the counter, vibrating it ▶ *   **Explanation 2 (Simple):** It simply fell off the counter or was knocked off by a pet or someone who left the house just before you arrived. According to Occam's Razor, you would favor **Explanation 2**. Why? *   **Explanation 1** requires several assumptions: the timing of a specific, small earthquake you didn't feel, the plate's exact position, and the specific vibration frequency needed to dislodge *just* that plate. ◀ *   **Explanation 2** requires fewer assumptions: gravity exists, objects fall, things get knocked over, pets are sometimes clumsy, or someone might have been a bit careless. These are common occurrences. ◀ Occam's Razor suggests that the simplest explanation (it fell or was knocked) is the more probable one, as it relies on far fewer unproven or unlikely factors than the earthquake scenario. You'd start by looking for signs of it falling or asking others in the house, rather than checking seismic activity reports."
