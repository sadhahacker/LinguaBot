Yeah, I like that idea. Then that gets you... Not as much pressure for tagging 1.0 before you go to Laracon. It gets an added benefit of getting people on the newsletter and a little bit more exposure in there. And then, you know, in the meantime, before you can, I don't know, maybe start drafting up newsletter launch email number one. Yeah. Get ready. Yeah, I might. Right now I'm using button down email for everything. May consider switching over to Bento just because Aaron loves it. And I like using things that people recommend. So. Yeah. I might switch providers right before I pull the trigger on it. So that's something I'm going to have to look at. And maybe I'll work on it on the plane or something. I'm on my way out to Denver. I don't know. It's just getting close, man. I leave on Sunday. It's Thursday. So this is all coming up really quick. And there's a lot I want to do. So maybe I don't sleep tonight. Yeah, but even if you just captured email addresses, you can always import them into the new place anyways. Yep. Yeah, 100%. So cool, man. Moving on from newsletters, I think you'd added something here about cloud custom commands. And that's something that we talked about, I think, last week a little bit. And we may be starting to find some excuses for using... slash custom slash commands and stuff. So I'd love to hear about your experience here. Yeah, definitely. So this was definitely prompted from last week's conversation. And as I'm working through the week, I was like, okay, what can I possibly make a custom command for? So I basically started off with two things. I created a refresh repo command, which basically you run it, it scans, it basically re-initiates the cloud MD file. It reads what's there. It looks at the application, sees any new dependencies or commands or whatever the case is, and updates anything that it deems important to add back to that markdown file. And it's just nice if you have a repo that has a lot of development, a lot of people working in it, and you don't always want to... capture every single new like merge or rebase like every other day to it so maybe your brew updates running that like the repo refresh like once a week or something like that would be good because then you don't have to type out like oh rescan the repo and do this and that and the other thing like now this will just take care of it so that was i think the first one that i made so that one's been really helpful refreshing everything because the first time i ran it it picked up like i think i last time i refreshed it was i don't know three four weeks ago so i found like a whole bunch more stuff it updated like architecture changes like a whole whole bunch of things uh to it so that's been really helpful probably gonna run that like on a weekly basis now on all the repos that we're working on. The other one is what I just named like a branch context is like, I'm either switching to a branch that I'm working on or pulling down for a review or something like that of like the, repo refreshes for main branch. And then when I'm going into something else like scan for changes, tell me what's in the last handful of commits and kind of refresh your understanding of what has changed in the repo in here. And then we can either work towards something else together, or I'm asking you for why did this change or why did that change or. whatever the case is. It's just refreshing the immediate context for that branch. So that's been helpful as well. That's sick. Yeah. So I guess I'll pause there because then I have another whole workflow. So any questions on either one of those or any specific details? No, man. I think that sounds great. Those are very useful things to have as slash commands. Yeah. Yeah, that's it's I'm still I'm still personally finding like. my own use cases for them. I haven't, I haven't dove too far into it yet. Um, but maybe after Laracon, I'll, I'll spend a little time, you know, coming up with some stuff, but I think those are like, I think it serves like some decent inspiration for some, some other slash commands I'm thinking up right now. So yeah. What else you got? Um, Yeah, so the next one, which I do a lot, is PR reviews for others and coming into a new tech stack. There's some things I am just not aware about or best practices or whatever. So there's a default slash review command that comes out of the box in cloud code. And that gives a decent understanding. It'll tell you what's changed, what maybe some of the...","language":"en","segments":[],"usage":{"prompt_audio_seconds":316,"prompt_tokens":4,"total_tokens":5201,"completion_tokens":1072}}
