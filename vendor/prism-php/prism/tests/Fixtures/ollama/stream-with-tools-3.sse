They asked two things: the time of the Tigers game in Detroit and whether they should wear a coat.\n\nFirst, I called the search function to find the game time. The response came back as 3pm today. That's straightforward. \n\nNext, I needed to check the weather in Detroit. I used the weather function, which said it's 75° and sunny. Since the temperature is relatively warm and sunny, wearing a coat probably isn't necessary. \n\nPutting it all together: the game is at 3pm, and the weather is nice, so the user shouldn't need a coat. I should present this information clearly and concisely.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe Detroit Tigers game is today at 3pm, and the weather in Detroit will be 75° and sunny.
